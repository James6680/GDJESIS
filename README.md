# GDJESIS
This Capstone project aims to create School Portal with a Web-based Enrollment and Student Information System (SIS) platform explicitly tailored for GDJES. This platform will enable real-time monitoring and management of student information, automate the enrollment process, and reduce paperwork and manual entry errors.
